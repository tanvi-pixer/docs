    "email": "john@example.com",
    "password": "securepassword123"
  }'

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- Passwords are automatically hashed before storage
- Email addresses are validated for proper format
- Duplicate email addresses are not allowed
- Admin users require additional verification in production
